This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Google logging
module.  Documentation for the implementation is in doc/.

See INSTALL for (generic) installation instructions for C++: basically
   ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

Or, with Bazel, add the following snippet to the WORKSPACE file:

    git_repository(
        name = "com_github_google_glog",
        remote = "https://github.com/google/glog.git",
        tag = 'REDACTED',
    )
